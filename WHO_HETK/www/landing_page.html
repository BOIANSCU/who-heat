    <h4>Welcome to the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT)!</h4>

<p>The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit enables the exploration and comparison of within-country health inequalities across countries. Assessing health inequalities guides evidence-based priority setting for defining equity-oriented health interventions.</p>
<p>You can <b>explore inequalities</b> in a country of interest, and then <b>compare inequalities</b> in the selected country with the situation in other countries. Inequalities can be assessed using disaggregated data and summary measures. Interactive tables and graphs reveal many facets of inequalities in a comprehensive and dynamic way.</p>
<p>HEAT is linked to the  <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HE-1540?lang=en">WHO Health Equity Monitor database</a>.  Data for Morocco from 2011 was provided by the country. Alternatively, data can be uploaded in a pre-defined format (please refer to the template). To get started, select the <i>Explore Inequality</i> tab and use the selection menu on the left in the <i>Disaggregated data – tables</i> or <i>Disaggregated data – graphs</i> tab to fetch data. Continue by exploring inequalities using summary measures, and comparing within-country inequalities across countries.</p>
